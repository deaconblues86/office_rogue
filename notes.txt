# General Notes
#----------------------------

#Maintain Needs -- social, hunger, energy, happiness, thirst, bladder, bowels, work
Still need to handle happiness
happiness -- Total of others weighted on preference.  Add other sources (crusing internet)?
# energy -- impacts move speed and work
# Social, hunger, thirst, bladder bowels -- declines based on stats.  Refilled once satisfied -- amount for thirst, hunger, social based on satisfaction.  Bowels and ballder decreased on consumption 
Need to tweak decline
# Must meet work expectations

Items:  Limit inventory to two
Coffee
water
chips
soda
flavored water
tea
pizza
sandwich
microwavable lunch
leftovers

Traits: Have some functions that handle a few of these.  Not implemented and should be data driven
Lazy - Productivity inversely impacts happiness
Chatty - Needs more social
Sluggish - Loses energy fster
workaholic - Productivity buff, loses happiness faster when not gaining Productivity
Caffine addict - loses happiness faster when not caffinated (implies status effects)
Rude - Decreases relationships during social
Charming - Increases relationships during social
atractive - increase to min relationship

-establish relationships based on traits and likes

Status:
Caffinated - Increased work gain
Crashing - Decreases work gain
Depressed - Decreases work gain
Sick - Decreases work gain.  Vomiting. Infectious


Likes: Should be data driven and not hard coded
work, movies, pina coladas, Hugh Grant, TV, sports, music, video games, rouge-likes, ASCII graphics, cars, motorcycles, fashion, drinking, dancing

Worker Types: Impacts base stats and has special roles in office
Manager - NPC who rules over all
Developer - Can improve terminal to incease Productivity/reduce energy drain
Marketing
HR - improve relationship with a chosen coworker
Finance
Sales
Consulting
Operations
IT - Restores worn out terminals
Cleaning staff - cleans toilets, urine, poo -- blocks bathroom when cleaning -- should have a cart to push around
Repair Man - services broken appliances

Durability:
Terminal - fixed by IT
Desk - fixed by getting supplies from supply closet
Appliances - fixed by repair man <-- Means you need an object type tag for refactoring to handle repairs

#----------------------------
# Refactoring
#----------------------------

Refactor object creation code to read data file
Instead of passing functions to usable items, give a satisfies tag (i.e. toilet satisfies bowels/bladder)
#These satisfies tags can then be read during object search to automatically find appropriate targets dynamically
Furthermore, use funcs are currently just the satisfies tag (basically) += a percentage of the max so these could be dynamically generated as well
Maybe further refine search by checking for objects that can statisfy multiple needs at the same time (i.e.coffee)

Refactor vend_func to have customizable "options".  Should be data drivem and can use something like the inventory menu (read from a list of vending machine objects)

Messages are good, could be spruced up, but will need a way to limit to FOV when time comes

Currently no logic for AI to manage inventory -- Theyll atleast use whats in their inventory first -- not so bad

# May be nice to not have to hard code class specific details (ITBasicCoworker, MaintCoworker)
Adopted work_func model on basicCoworker to avoid the above line
^ This same model can be used to control preferences as well
- Or to hardcode what each one fixes -- could use a db or flat file or give each object special tags (obj_type=appliance obj_type=tech)
^ Thinking DB the way to go as it offers fast access and could easily be used to saved games.
~ obj_types have been set up, appliance, tech, furniture, but arent being read

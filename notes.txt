- Really need to fix inventory
- Action object menu more or less works, but bumping terminal shouldn't present drink_water_bottle as an option (though it is an available action)
- Coworkers just currently sit still spamming "can't satisfy" if, more than likely, they find themselves unable to path to target
    - regardless of the reason, they should try to do something else in the meantime
- Don't know how reagent list attr of Action is supposed to be populated, but right now drink_water_bottle/eating_snack is kind of F'ed
    - they have their item listed as a reagent but the effects are applied to the target (which presumably is the water bottle and snack as it seems to work)

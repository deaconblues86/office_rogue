- Action object menu more or less works, but bumping terminal shouldn't present drink_water_bottle as an option (though it is an available action)
- Coworkers just currently sit still spamming "can't satisfy" if, more than likely, they find themselves unable to path to target
    - regardless of the reason, they should try to do something else in the meantime
- Don't know how reagent list attr of Action is supposed to be populated, but right now drink_water_bottle/eating_snack is kind of F'ed
    - they have their item listed as a reagent but the effects are applied to the target (which presumably is the water bottle and snack as it seems to work)
- Occasionally Coworkers seem to get "stuck"...  unclear if rendering is not updating for a spell or something wierd is occuring with movement (like ghost walking)


- Witnessed a huge scary tantrem of unable to satisfy work across all job types - could be something to do with action weighting or maybe unable to perform memories?
    -> This should be resolved now
    -> added new unsatisfied list to Memories, though probably not really necessary as its never actually checked by coworker
     - coworker just continues to iterate over same list each time
    -> additionally, refactored check_needs method a bit to clean things up

- Fired coworkers, including player, seem to resurrect and continue roaming
 - could be that delete_object doesn't work, as has been guessed in a note, or that I simply lost count of the workers
 - Player could be special too

# General Notes
#----------------------------

#Maintain Needs -- social, hunger, energy, happiness, thirst, bladder, bowels, work
Still need to handle happiness
happiness -- Total of others weighted on preference.  Add other sources (crusing internet)?
# energy -- impacts move speed and work
# Social, hunger, thirst, bladder bowels -- declines based on stats.  Refilled once satisfied -- amount for thirst, hunger, social based on satisfaction.  Bowels and ballder decreased on consumption 
Need to tweak decline
# Must meet work expectations

Items:  Limit inventory to two
Coffee
water
chips
soda
flavored water
tea
pizza
sandwich
microwavable lunch
leftovers

Traits: Have some functions that handle a few of these.  Not implemented and should be data driven
Lazy - Productivity inversely impacts happiness
Chatty - Needs more social
Sluggish - Loses energy fster
workaholic - Productivity buff, loses happiness faster when not gaining Productivity
Caffine addict - loses happiness faster when not caffinated (implies status effects)
Rude - Decreases relationships during social
Charming - Increases relationships during social
atractive - increase to min relationship

-establish relationships based on traits and likes

Status:
Caffinated - Increased work gain
Crashing - Decreases work gain
Depressed - Decreases work gain
Sick - Decreases work gain.  Vomiting. Infectious


Likes: Should be data driven and not hard coded
work, movies, pina coladas, Hugh Grant, TV, sports, music, video games, rouge-likes, ASCII graphics, cars, motorcycles, fashion, drinking, dancing

Worker Types: Impacts base stats and has special roles in office
Manager - NPC who rules over all
Developer - Can improve terminal to incease Productivity/reduce energy drain
Marketing
HR - improve relationship with a chosen coworker
Finance
Sales
Consulting
Operations
IT - Restores worn out terminals
Cleaning staff - cleans toilets, urine, poo -- blocks bathroom when cleaning -- should have a cart to push around
Repair Man - services broken appliances

Durability:
Terminal - fixed by IT
Desk - fixed by getting supplies from supply closet
Appliances - fixed by repair man <-- Means you need an object type tag for refactoring to handle repairs

#----------------------------
# Refactoring
#----------------------------

Maybe further refine search by checking for objects that can statisfy multiple needs at the same time (i.e.coffee)
Messages are good, could be spruced up, but will need a way to limit to FOV when time comes
Currently no logic for AI to manage inventory -- Theyll atleast use whats in their inventory first & dump trash
